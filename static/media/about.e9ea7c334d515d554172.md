 Hi there! I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for designing and creating products. The journey from an idea to a fully realized product excites me, and I love being a part of it. Here's a little more about what drives me:

- **Front-End & Back-End Development**: The synergy between interfaces and API development is where I thrive. Crafting seamless interactions between the two helps in building an efficient system.

- **Product Design & Planning**: I enjoy mapping out the features of a product, ensuring that it's not only functional but also engaging and user-friendly.

- **Intrigued by Web Technologies**: I have a keen interest in understanding the underlying principles behind web technologies such as WebSocket, Kafka, and more. My curiosity pushes me to explore more complex systems, unraveling the intricate details that make them tick.

- **Interest in Data Applications**: Particularly in the field of computer vision, I find the application of data fascinating. The way machines can interpret and understand visual information is an area I'm eager to explore further.

- **Analyzing & Solving Problems with Data**: I believe in the power of data to identify issues. Analyzing this information allows me to formulate solutions that are not just theoretical but actionable.

- **Love for Graphic Design**: Visual aesthetics matter to me. I take pleasure in graphic design, creating visuals that are not only pleasing to the eye but also align with the essence of the product.

I am always on the lookout for challenges that push my boundaries, and I believe in continuous learning to keep myself updated with the ever-evolving tech world. Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
